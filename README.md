# folder-script-py
 **Script that makes folder structure for you**

 This script was made out of **Python** and makes a folder structure for you. 
 
 The script will ask you for the head name (name of the head folder), the script will also ask your for a title (the tittle is the tittle of your "index.html").
 Once everything is done you will get an html folder, a css folder with "style.css" inside, an img folder, a js folder with "script.js" in it and the index on the main folder will be linked to the **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

 **This script will make the map structre easier for new Web Develepers and experienced develepers.**
